This WAF uses the Flask web framework to handle HTTP requests. It defines a before_request function that is called before each request is processed. In this function, it checks for SQL injection attempts and requests from known malicious IPs, and aborts the request with a 403 error if these conditions are met. It also logs all requests to a file.
Note that this WAF is a basic example and is not meant to be used in a production environment without further development and testing.
In terms of source code, a WAF can be a complex and customized solution, and its code can vary greatly depending on the language and framework used, as well as the specific functionality and architecture designed. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a single source code example that covers all possible cases. However, the code snippet above provides a simple example of how a WAF can be implemented in Python using the FlaskÂ framework.
