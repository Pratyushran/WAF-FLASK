# WAF-FLASK
A web application firewall (WAF) is a security solution that protects web applications from attacks by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between the application and the internet. A WAF can prevent attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file inclusion.
### Goal:
Develop a WAF using Python and the Flask web framework to protect web applications from common web vulnerabilities and attacks.
### Primary Focus:
To filter, monitor, and block malicious incoming HTTP requests to ensure the security of web applications.
## Key Components:

### Request Handler: 
Implement a component to intercept incoming HTTP requests before they reach the web application.
### Rule Engine:
Develop a set of rules to detect and block malicious requests based on known attack patterns (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
### Logging and Reporting:
Create a logging system to record blocked requests and generate reports.
### User Interface: 
Build a web-based dashboard using Flask to allow administrators to manage and configure the WAF settings.
### Real-time Monitoring:
Implement real-time monitoring to track and analyze incoming traffic.
### Alerting:
Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential threats or attacks.
